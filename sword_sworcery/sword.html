    <div class="bastard">
      <p>The Bastard Sword <span class="price">$Too Expensive</span><br />
      <small>The Bastard sword IRL was used by noblemen that could afford plate amor, and thus didn't need a sheild.  It is a two handed sword. </small></p>
    </div>

    <div class="katana">
      <p>The Katana <span class="price">$Way too Expensive</span><br />
      <small>The Katana was used in Japan, and is not relevant to Game of Thrones at all.  But if you are going to talk about swrods, how can you not mention the Katana?.</small></p>
    </div>

    <div class="falshion">
      <p>The Falshion <span class="price">$Stupid Expensive</span><br />
      <small>The Falshion started out as a sword for peasants that didn't have armor, but later it became fashionable even for the nobility, and stayed in use past gunpowder, and armor's obsolescence.</small></p>
